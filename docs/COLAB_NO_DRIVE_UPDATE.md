# Colab Notebook Update - No Google Drive Required

## What Changed

### ❌ Removed
- Google Drive mounting
- All references to `/content/drive/MyDrive/`
- Dependencies on Google Drive for storage

### ✅ Added
- Pure ZIP file workflow
- Local storage in Colab (`/content/cross_validation_results/`)
- Download section (Section 9) with:
  - Automatic ZIP creation
  - Direct download from Colab
  - Instructions for local extraction

## New Workflow

### In Colab:
1. **Upload** ZIP files → Extract to `/content/data/`
2. **Train** models → Save to `/content/cross_validation_results/`
3. **Download** results → ZIP and download to local machine

### Locally:
1. **Extract** downloaded ZIP
2. **Evaluate** all folds
3. **Test** best model on held-out subject

## Benefits

✅ **Simpler setup** - No Drive mounting needed  
✅ **Faster start** - Skip Drive authentication  
✅ **Self-contained** - All data in session  
✅ **Explicit download** - Clear when to download results  
✅ **No Drive quota** - Doesn't use Drive storage  

## Key Changes in Notebook

### Section 1: Setup Environment
- Removed Drive mounting cell
- Updated GPU check with warning message

### Section 2: Data Upload (renamed from "Configure Data Paths")
- Single cell for upload + extraction
- Creates `/content/data/Synth_LR_nii` and `/content/data/HR_nii`
- Output to `/content/cross_validation_results/` (local)
- Clear verification messages

### Section 9: Download Results (NEW)
Three new cells:
1. **Prepare ZIP** - Creates `cross_validation_results.zip`
2. **Download ZIP** - Downloads to your computer
3. **Continue Locally** - Instructions for next steps

## Updated Documentation

Modified these files to match new workflow:
- `docs/COLAB_TO_LOCAL_WORKFLOW.md` - Updated Part 2 (Download section)
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Updated Step 3 (Download instructions)

## Usage

### In Colab:
```python
# Section 2: Upload when prompted
# Synth_LR_nii.zip and HR_nii.zip

# Section 5: Training runs
# Models saved to /content/cross_validation_results/

# Section 9: After training
# Cell 1: Prepare ZIP
# Cell 2: Download ZIP
```

### Locally:
```bash
# Extract downloaded results
cd synthsup-speechMRI-recon
unzip ~/Downloads/cross_validation_results.zip -d ./cv_models

# Evaluate
python utils/evaluate_all_folds.py \
    --models-dir ./cv_models \
    --input-dir ../Synth_LR_nii \
    --target-dir ../HR_nii \
    --output-dir ./evaluation_results
```

## Storage Comparison

### Old (with Drive):
- Upload: 2 ZIP files to Colab
- Storage: Google Drive (~180-300 MB)
- Download: Via Drive web/desktop

### New (no Drive):
- Upload: 2 ZIP files to Colab
- Storage: Colab session (~180-300 MB)
- Download: Direct from Colab (~180-300 MB ZIP)

**Result:** Same total data transfer, simpler workflow!

## Notes

- Session data is temporary - download before closing Colab
- ZIP creation takes ~1-2 minutes
- Download speed depends on your connection
- Manual folder download still available as backup
